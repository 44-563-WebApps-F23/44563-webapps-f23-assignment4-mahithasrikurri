       <p class ="speech"></p>But you don't now? Not in the least?</p>
        
        
        <h5 class=" name KAIA" >KAIA.</h5>
        <p class="direction">[Passionately, clasping hands and holding them out towards him.]</p>
        <p class ="speech"></p>Oh, you know very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never
        care for any one else.</p>
        
        
        <h5><p class="name SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h5>
        <p class ="speech"></p>Yes, you say that. And yet you go away from me--leave me alone here with
        everything on my hands.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class=" name KAIA" >KAIA.</h5>
        <p class ="speech"></p>But could I not stay with you, even if Ragnar--?</p>
        
        
        <h5><p class="name SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h5>
        <p class="direction">[Repudiating the idea.]</p>
        <p class ="speech"></p> No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar
        leaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will
        need you himself.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class=" name KAIA" >KAIA.</h5>
        <p class="direction">[Wringing her hands.]</p>
        <p class ="speech"></p> Oh, I feel as if I could not be separated from
        you! It's quite, quite impossible!</p>
        
        
        <h5><p class="name SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h5>
        <p class ="speech"></p>Then be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar's head. Marry
        him as much as you please--<p class="direction">[Alters his tone.]</p><p class ="speech"></p>I mean--don't let him
        throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too, my
        dear Kaia.</p>
        
        
        <h5 class=" name KAIA" >KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p class ="speech"></p>Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!</p>

        <p class="direction">[Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers.]</p>
        <p class ="speech"></p>For I cannot get on
        without you, you see. I must have you with me every single day.</p>
