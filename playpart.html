    <h2>Mahitha "acts in a play"</h2>
    <h4>The Master Builder (Henrik Ibsen)</h4>
    <p>KAIA.<br>

        [Softly, still writing.] Well?<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        Why do you always take that shade off when I come?<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>
        
        [As before.] I look so ugly with it on.<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        [Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>
        
        [Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        [Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>
        
        [Bending her head.] Hush--they can hear you!<br>
        
             [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
               at the door of the draughtsmen's office.<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        Has any one been here for me?<br>
        
        
        RAGNAR.<br>
        
        [Rising.] Yes, the young couple who want a villa built, out at
        Lovstrand.<br>
