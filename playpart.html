    <h2>Mahitha "acts in a play"</h2>
    <h4>The Master Builder (Henrik Ibsen)</h4>
    <p>KAIA.<br>

        [Softly, still writing.] Well?<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        Why do you always take that shade off when I come?<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>
        
        [As before.] I look so ugly with it on.<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        [Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>
        
        [Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        [Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>
        
        [Bending her head.] Hush--they can hear you!<br>
        
             [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
               at the door of the draughtsmen's office.<br>
        
        
        SOLNESS.<br>
        
        Has any one been here for me?<br>
        
        
        KAIA.<br>

        Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!<br>

        SOLNESS.<br>

        [Curtly.] No, of course not. [Looks sternly at her.] Kaia!<br>


        KAIA.<br>

        [Anxiously, in a low voice.] Yes!<br>


        SOLNESS.<br>

        [Points imperatively to a spot on the floor.] Come here! At once!<br>


        KAIA.<br>

        [Hesitatingly.] Yes.<br>


        SOLNESS.<br>

        [As before.] Nearer!<br>


       KAIA.<br>

       [Obeying.] What do you want with me?<br>


      SOLNESS.<br>

      [Looks at her for a while.] Is it you I have to thank for all this?<br>


      KAIA.<br>

     No, no, don't think that!<br>


      SOLNESS.<br>

     But confess now--you want to get married!<br>


      KAIA.<br>

      [Softly.] Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years, and
      so--<br>


     SOLNESS.<br>

     And so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?<br>


    KAIA.<br>

    Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.<br>


   SOLNESS.<br>

   [More gently.] Kaia, don't you really care a little bit for Ragnar, too?<br>
   KAIA.<br>

   I cared very much for Ragnar once--before I came here to you.<br>
