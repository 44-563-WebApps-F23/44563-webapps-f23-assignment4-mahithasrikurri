    <h2>Mahitha "acts in a play"</h2>
    <h4>The Master Builder (Henrik Ibsen)</h4>
    <p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.<h5>KAIA.</h5>
        <p>[Softly, still writing.]</p> Well?</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        Why do you always take that shade off when I come?</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[As before.]</p> I look so ugly with it on.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        <p>[Smiling.]</p> Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[Half glancing up at him.]</p> Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        <p>[Strokes her hair gently.]</p> Poor, poor little Kaia--</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[Bending her head.]</p> Hush--they can hear you!</p>
        
             <p>[SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
               at the door of the draughtsmen's office.]</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        Has any one been here for me?</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

        Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!</p>

        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

         <p>[Curtly.]</p> No, of course not. <p>[Looks sternly at her.]</p> Kaia!</p>


        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

        <p>[Anxiously, in a low voice.]</p> Yes!</p>


        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

            <p>[Points imperatively to a spot on the floor.]</p> Come here! At once!</p>


        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

        <p>[Hesitatingly.]</p> Yes.</p>


        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

        <p>[As before.]</p> Nearer!</p>


       <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

       <p>[Obeying.]</p> What do you want with me?</p>


      <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

      <p>[Looks at her for a while.]</p> Is it you I have to thank for all this?</p>


      <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

     No, no, don't think that!</p>


      <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

      But confess now--you want to get married!</p>

     <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

      <p>[Softly.]</p> Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years, and
      so--</p>


      <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

     And so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?</p>


     <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

    Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.</p>


   <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>

   <p>[More gently.]</p> Kaia, don't you really care a little bit for Ragnar, too?</p>

   <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>

   I cared very much for Ragnar once--before I came here to you.</p>
