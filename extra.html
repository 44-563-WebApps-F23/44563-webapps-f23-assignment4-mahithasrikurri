        But you don't now? Not in the least?</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[Passionately, clasping hands and holding them out towards him.]</p> Oh, you
        know very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never
        care for any one else.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        Yes, you say that. And yet you go away from me--leave me alone here with
        everything on my hands.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        But could I not stay with you, even if Ragnar--?</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        <p>[Repudiating the idea.]</p> No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar
        leaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will
        need you himself.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[Wringing her hands.]</p> Oh, I feel as if I could not be separated from
        you! It's quite, quite impossible!</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        Then be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar's head. Marry
        him as much as you please--<p>[Alters his tone.]</p> I mean--don't let him
        throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too, my
        dear Kaia.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        <p>[Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers.]</p> For I cannot get on
        without you, you see. I must have you with me every single day.</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[In nervous exaltation.]</p> My God! My God!</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech SOLNESS">SOLNESS speech.</p><h5>SOLNESS.</h5>
        
        <p>[Kisses her hair.]</p> Kaia--Kaia!</p>
        
        
        <p><p class=" Speech KAIA">KAIA speech.</p><h5>KAIA.</h5>
        
        <p>[Sinks down before him.]</p> Oh, how good you are to me! How unspeakably
        good you are!</p>
